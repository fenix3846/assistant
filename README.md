# assistant
this is a project in which I try and build my own personal assistant with python.

in this set of code we used:-
1)variables
2)input() function
3)if command
4)pyttsx3 module
  datetime module
  etc.
 
this was a really fun project so, if you want to try it yourself then you are free to come.
